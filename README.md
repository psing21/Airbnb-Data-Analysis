# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis

This project was developed during my first semester in the Data Science program at the **University of New Haven**. The goal was to analyze Airbnb listings data and uncover patterns that influence pricing, availability, and listing performance.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `Airbnb Data.csv`: The main dataset containing Airbnb listing details such as location, price, availability, and more.
- `Airbnb Data Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook used for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- `Airbnb Data Analysis PPT.pptx`: A visual presentation summarizing project objectives, methods, key insights, and conclusions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand trends and pricing dynamics in Airbnb listings.
- Explore how factors like room type, location, and reviews impact prices.
- Visualize the distribution and availability of listings.
- Identify actionable insights that may help hosts optimize listings.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and formatted relevant fields.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Price distribution and outlier detection.
  - Analysis of room types and their pricing patterns.
  - Availability trends across listings.
  - Relationship between number of reviews and listing popularity.
- **Visualization**: Created charts and plots using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PowerPoint** (for presenting results)

## 📌 Insights & Learnings

- Listings with **more reviews** tended to have more consistent pricing.
- **Entire homes/apartments** had the highest average prices, while **shared rooms** were more affordable.
- Some areas had **high density of listings** but varied widely in price depending on availability and room type.
- Data quality and preprocessing significantly impacted the accuracy and depth of insights.

## 🧠 Academic Context

This project was a part of my coursework at the University of New Haven and reflects my early hands-on experience with data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
