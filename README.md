# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis

This project was developed at the **University of New Haven** to analyze Airbnb listings data and uncover patterns related to pricing, availability, and listing performance.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `Airbnb Data.csv`: The primary dataset containing Airbnb listing information.
- `Airbnb Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `Airbnb Data Analysis PPT.pptx`: Presentation summarizing objectives, methods, findings, and insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze pricing trends and availability patterns.
- Examine the influence of room type, location, and review count on listing price.
- Identify insights that can help optimize listing strategies.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, formatted columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Price distribution and outliers
  - Room type vs price comparison
  - Availability patterns across listings
  - Correlation between reviews and popularity
- **Visualizations**: Plots and charts created using Python libraries to illustrate findings clearly.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: For final presentation

## 📌 Insights & Learnings

- Listings with **more reviews** tended to have more consistent pricing.
- **Entire homes/apartments** had the highest average prices, while **shared rooms** were more affordable.
- Some areas had **high density of listings** but varied widely in price depending on availability and room type.
- Data quality and preprocessing significantly impacted the accuracy and depth of insights.
- Visualization plays a critical role in uncovering patterns and supporting data-driven conclusions.
